# TicTacToe-Game
Use Postman or any other tool, to see the game.
you run the server with the command node app.js or nodemon app.js, as the output is at the server side.
the flow of the rotues should be:
 1. /StartGame which require an input from body (playerID) and returns the MatchID.
 2. /JoinGame which require an input from body (playerID) it has to be different from the playerID at the line before.
 3. /play each time in the console you can see who'se turn is it by the player ID.
